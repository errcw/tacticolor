  + map size
  + territories all or partially assigned

  + instructions on/off
  + storage device
- Game configuration below lobby entries
  + Panel of four slots for players
  + Game configuration (map size, AI difficulty) immediately below
  + Start game below (or ready for multiplayer)
- Lobby
  + Invalidate player readiness when game configuration changes
  + Show blank entries for non-local games until configuration arrives
